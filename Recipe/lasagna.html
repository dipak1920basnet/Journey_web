    <h3> Desciption: </h3>
    <p> In Tibetan and Nepali cuisine, momos are a sort of steamed filled dumpling that are also well-liked in neighboring Bhutan and India. While most momos from Nepal are spherical, like baozi, most momos from Tibet are half-moon shaped, like jiaozi. <br> The sauce known as achar, which is typically eaten with momos, is inspired by the spices and herbs found in many South Asian cuisines. <br> It can also be prepared as soups, called jhol momo or mokthuk, from boiling pork or buffalo bones combined with a variety of herbs and vegetables, or as achar, a broth created from tomatoes, sesame seeds, chillies, cumin, and coriander. </p>
